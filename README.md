## Problem Statement
- Problem Statement Create an AI agent that leverages the capabilities of a large language model. This agent should be able to extract answers based on the content of a large PDF document and post the results on Slack. Ideally, you use OpenAI LLMs. You can also use the Langchain or LLama Index framework to implement this agentic functionality.



## Dataset
- PDF document (handbook.pdf)



## Retrieval-Augmented Generation
-  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful framework that integrates retrieval into the sequence generation process. Essentially, RAG operates by fetching relevant documents or data snippets based on a query and then using this retrieved information to generate a coherent and contextually appropriate response



## Technologies Used
- Python
- Langchain
- Tiktoken
- Chroma
- OpenAIEmbeddings
- ChatOpenAI
- SlackToolkit
- AgentExecutor



## Conclusions
- The purpose of this project is to ask questions about the content of your custom or private data, which is stored in different formats such as Pandas, Dataframes, PDFs, CSV or Json files, HTML or office documents.
