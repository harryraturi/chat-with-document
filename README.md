Problem Statement Create an AI agent that leverages the capabilities of a large language model. This agent should be able to extract answers based on the content of a large PDF document and post the results on Slack. Ideally, you use OpenAI LLMs. You can also use the Langchain or LLama Index framework to implement this agentic functionality.
